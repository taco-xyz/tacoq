        """Get the broker information for a worker kind. Checks locally before
        fetching from the manager.

        ### Usage
        The publisher and the worker use this information
        in different ways:
        - The publisher uses the routing key to correctly route the task to the
        appropriate queues. This information is fetched from the manager the first
        time a new worker kind is used in task submission.
        - The worker uses the queue name to consume the correct queue. This information
        is fetched from the manager on startup, and the worker will only connect to the
        queue once it gets a response from the manager.


        ### Constraints
        This information could be computed within the SDK, but for the sake of consistency
        and easier portability to each language, we let the manager handle this logic instead.
        The manager also handles queue and exchange creation, so the SDKs can be lightweight.

        This means the entire system hinges on the manager being required for any of the
        SDKs to start up, which is something we want to address in the future. One idea
        for addressing this is having a Rust-based library that each SDK can use to set
        up the necessary queues and exchanges, and the logic is shared across all languages.

        - `worker_kind`: The worker kind to register
