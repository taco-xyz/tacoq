"""Publisher client for the TacoQ client SDK.

The publisher client abstracts the details of communicating with
the broker and relay. This is a public-facing class that can
be used to both publish tasks and retrieve their current status
and eventual output.

    """A client for publishing and retrieving tasks.

    ### Attributes
    - broker_config: The configuration for the broker. See `BrokerConfig` for more details on how to configure it.

    ### Usage
    ```python
    from core.infra.broker import BrokerConfig
    from core.infra.relay import RelayConfig

    # Make sure RabbitMQ is running for tihs one!
    broker_config = BrokerConfig(

        - task_kind: The kind of the task. Can either be in the format of `worker_kind:task_name` string or a `TaskKind` object.
        - worker_kind: The kind of worker that will execute the task.
        - input_data: The data to publish.

        ### Returns
        - `TaskInstance`: The task instance.

        ### Usage
        You can publish a task with the following code:
        ```python
        task = await publisher.publish_task(
            task_kind="task_name",

            input_data="Hello, world!",
            priority=5,
        )
        ```
        You can also inject the OpenTelemetry context carrier to track the task's lifecycle:
        ```python
        otel_ctx_carrier = {"trace_id": "1234567890", "span_id": "1234567890"}
        task = await publisher.publish_task(

            worker_kind="worker_kind",
