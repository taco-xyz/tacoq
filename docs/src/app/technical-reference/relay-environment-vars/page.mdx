# Configuration

You can configure the Relay by passing it environment variables. For example:

```yaml {5-7}
relay:
    image: ghcr.io/taco-xyz/tacoq-relay:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      TACOQ_DATABASE_URL: postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/tacoq
      TACOQ_BROKER_URL: amqp://user:password@localhost:5672
```

# Variables

## Infrastructure Connections

The connections to the broker and the database can be configured using the following environment variables:

- `TACOQ_BROKER_URL` - The URL of the broker. Example: `amqp://username:password@host:port/vhost`
- `TACOQ_DATABASE_URL` - The URL of the database. Example: `postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name`

## Functional Decomposition

The relay serves multiple purposes and you might want to replicate only a 
subset of its functionality. You can use the following environment variables to disable
unwanted functionality:

- `TACOQ_ENABLE_RELAY_TASK_CONSUMER` - Whether to enable the relay consuming the tasks from the broker. Default: `true`
- `TACOQ_ENABLE_RELAY_CLEANUP` - Whether to enable the routine cleanup of expired tasks. Default: `true`
- `TACOQ_ENABLE_RELAY_API` - Whether to enable the relay Axum API. Default: `true`

## Telemetry

The telemetry configuration can be set using the following environment variables:

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` - The endpoint for sending OpenTelemetry traces. Default: `http://localhost:4317`
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL` - The protocol for sending traces. Default: `grpc`
- `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` - The sampling strategy for traces. Default: `always_on`
- `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` - The service name for telemetry. Default: `tacoq.relay`
