# System Services

These are services that are part of the TacoQ core system. The user doesn't 
use these directly in their code and they exist purely to transport and store
task data.

## Broker

### Broker Responsabilities

The broker is responsible for transporting task objects between services. This
works by having a central exchange that routes **all task objects to the 
relay** and new tasks to be executed to the **appropriate worker**. 

### RabbitMQ Implementation Details

The broker is implemented in RabbitMQ. Its structure is as follows:

- The `relay_queue`, which is consumed by the Relay to continuously update the
  task database. When a worker starts or finishes executing a task, they send
  an update directly to this queue.
- One queue per worker kind. More on worker kinds in the
  [Worker](/technical-reference/system-architecture/#h2-worker) section.
- A `task_exchange` exchange to which new tasks are published, being routed to
  the appropriate worker queue based on their routing key (which is dictated
  by the worker kind in the task object).

Queues and exchanges are not customizable because RabbitMQ doesn't like it
when different services declare different queue and exchange configurations
(it crashes). Therefore:

- All queues and exchanges are [durable](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/queues#durability) - 
  they will survive a RabbitMQ server restart. 
- All queues and exchanges are [do not auto-delete](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/queues#properties) - 
  they will not be deleted when the last consumer disconnects.
- All queues have a default `{"x-max-priority": 255}` to allow for maximum 
  flexibility in [task priority](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/priority) and to
  have the priority feature available by default.

<Note>
  We **do not plan on supporting additional brokers in the near future**, 
  but we are open to making the broker an abstract class and accepting 
  contributions for other message brokers if there is enough demand.

  This is because we rely on RabbitMQ's routing and priorities features, which
  are not always present in other brokers.
</Note>

## Database

The latest state of each task is stored in the database. The database is 
implemented in Postgres and managed via Rust's [sqlx](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/)
library by the relay.

<Note>
  Some Postgres-backed task queues like [Hatchet](https://hatchet.run/) store 
  every event and use triggers to keep a materialized view with the latest state 
  of each task up to date. 

  We do not do this for a few reasons:
  - As the Hatchet team has noted, it is no easy feat to get the triggers 
    right.
  - Unlike Hatchet, we are only a task queue, not a workflow orchestrator -
    it is not as important for us to store information about every step of a
    workflow.
  - We already support OTEL tracing. We believe this is enough to get 
    observability into the system. The task also has information about the
    timeline of its execution.
</Note> 

<Note>
  We use some Postgres-specific features like `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` to implement
  event-based task updates with the clients. Because of this, we do not plan on
  suporting other databases in the near future.
</Note>

## Relay

The relay, as the name implies, is responsible for relaying information 
between the core services and the user's application. It is implemented in Rust
and has the following capabilities:

### 1. Task Update Consumer

The relay consumes task updates from the broker and stores them in the database as they come in.

### 2. Data Retrieval

The relay also serves a **REST API** for retrieving task data from the database. 
You can read the API swagger definition in [Relay Endpoints](/technical-reference/relay-endpoints).
The REST API is implemented in [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/).

### 3. Cleanup

The relay will run a job to delete tasks that have been in the database for
longer than a set period of time specified by the user. An index exists on the
TTL column of the database to make this operation efficient.

### 4. Replication

The relay is stateless and can be scaled horizontally if you need to
load balance requests between multiple relays or increase the consuming
rate of tasks.

<Tip>
  The relay has a lot of features packaged into a single service for the sake of simplicity.

  If you only want to scale the consuming rate of tasks horizontally but you don't need more APIs,
  you can use the environment variables `ENABLE_RELAY_TASK_CONSUMER`, `ENABLE_RELAY_CLEANUP` and
  `ENABLE_RELAY_API` to disable the features you don't need. Read more about environment variables
  in the [Relay environment variables](/technical-reference/relay-environment-variables) section.
</Tip>

# User Services

These are set up by the user himself and can safely go online and offline as 
needed.

## Worker

The worker is responsible for executing tasks. Each worker has a `worker_kind`
and multiple `task_kind`'s that it is capable of executing.

<Note>
  Why are worker kinds a thing?

  It is not uncommon for task queues to have all their workers consume from the
  same queue. If you were to have two different workers with different task
  capabilities, they would often consume tasks they are unable to execute, NACK
  them, and send the task to the back of the queue. This could happen repeatedly
  and cause the task to never be executed, or at least be greatly delayed.

  Another possible implementation would be to have one queue per task kind, which
  would allow workers to only consume the queues they know they are able to 
  execute. This would, however, require the worker to have a strategy for 
  determining which queue to prioritize consuming, increasing complexity and making
  the behaviour more opaque.

  So, we make the user explicitely decide which worker to route their task to,
  and we make the worker kind part of the task object.

  The drawbacks to the current approach are:
  - Additional setup parameter that must be known pre-runtime.
  - There cannot be two different worker kinds with the shared task kind 
    capabilities. The user must always choose which worker kind to route a task to.

  Given these extremely specific drawbacks which apply to almost no one and can
  easily be worked around, we've decided to use worker kinds to route tasks. If 
  you have a better idea, please let us know! :)

## Publisher Client

A task publisher client isn't a service but a client for submitting tasks to your 
workers. It connects directly to the broker.

## Relay Client

As task results are completed, they get stored in the database. To access them,
an application must communicate with the relay via REST API. So, the client SDKs
have a **Relay Client** built in, whom is capable for retrieving task results via
the REST API.
