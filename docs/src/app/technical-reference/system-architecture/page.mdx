# System Services

These are services that are part of the TacoQ core system. The user doesn't 
use these directly in their code and they exist purely to transport and store
task data.

## Broker

The broker, implemented in RabbitMQ, is responsible for transporting task objects
between services. This works by having a central exchange that routes **all
task objects to the relay** and new tasks to be executed to the **appropriate worker**.

We **do not plan on supporting additional brokers in the near future**, though we
are open to making the broker an abstract class and accepting contributions for
other message brokers if there is enough demand.

### RabbitMQ Implementation Details

The basic structure of the broker infrastructure is as follows:

- A task exchange to which new tasks are published
- One queue per worker kind - the task exchange filters new tasks to be routed
to the appropriate queue
- The relay queue. All tasks that go through the task exchange are routed to 
the relay queue, but new task results are published directly to the queue 
rather than the exchange.

All queues and exchanges are **durable** and **do not auto-delete**. All
queues have a default `{"x-max-priority": 255}` to allow for maximum flexibility
in task priority and to have the priority feature available by default.

## Database

The latest state of each task is stored in the database by the relay. The database is 
implemented in Postgres and managed via Rust's SQLX by the relay.

**We want to support more relational databases in the near future**, namely 
SQLite to make the local development experience easier.

## Relay

The relay, as the name implies, is responsible for relaying information 
between the core services and the user's application. It is implemented in Rust.

### Task Update Consumer

The relay consumes task updates from the broker and stores them in the database as they come in.

### Data Retrieval

The relay also serves a **REST API** for retrieving task data from the database. 
You can read the API swagger definition in [Relay Endpoints](/technical-reference/relay-endpoints). 

### Cleanup

The relay will run a cron job to delete tasks that have been in the database for
longer than a set period of time specified by the user.

### Replication

The relay is stateless and can be scaled horizontally if you need to
load balance requests between multiple relays or increase the consuming
rate of tasks.

### Rust Implementation Details

The relay is implemented in Rust with the following specs:
- The API is an Axum app
- The database is managed via SQLX
- The task update consumer is a background task running in parallel with the API
- The cleanup is a background task running as a cronjob. We've decided to not
make it a Postgres job so that we can support additional datastores in the future.

# User Services

These are set up by the user himself and can safely go online and offline as 
needed.

## Worker

The worker is responsible for executing tasks. Each worker has a `worker_kind`
and multiple `task_kind`'s that it is capable of executing.

    <LightBulbIcon className="size-20 h-fit"/>
    <span className="text-blue-200">
        Why are worker kinds a thing?
        
        It is not uncommon for task queues to all share the same queue. If you were to
        have two different workers with different task capabilities, they would often
        consume tasks they are unable to execute, NACK them, and send the task to the
        back of the queue. This could happen repeatedly and cause the task to never be
        executed.

        Another possible implementation would be to have one queue per task kind, which
        would allow workers to only consume the queues they know they are able to 
        execute. This would, however, require the worker to have a strategy for 
        determining which queue to prioritize consuming, which would increase complexity.

        The drawbacks to the current approach are:
        1. Additional setup parameter that must be known pre-runtime.
        2. There cannot be two different worker kinds with the shared task kind 
        capabilities. The user must always choose which worker kind to route a task to.

        Given these extremely specific drawbacks which apply to almost no one and can
        easily be worked around, we've decided to use worker kinds to route tasks.

## Publisher

A task publisher serves two purposes:

1. Publish a task for the workers to work on. This task is published to the 
task exchange on the broker, which is then routed to the relay and to the worker.
2. Retrieve task results by querying the relay's API, which queries the database.

The publisher doesn't need to be its own service, anything can be a 
publisher - a FastAPI app, a CLI, even a worker.
