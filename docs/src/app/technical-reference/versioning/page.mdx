# Semantic Versioning

Until TacoQ reaches 1.0, it will adhere to the following versioning scheme:

- The **major** version will stay at 0.
- The **minor** version increases for breaking changes or major features.
- The **patch** version increases for non-breaking changes.

Once we reach a stable 1.0, TacoQ will follow [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

# SDK and Image Lockstep Releases

For the time being, breaking changes in either the SDKs or the Relay image will
result in a new minor version - they are released in lockstep.

Patch versions are not locked.

# Task Object

Objects passed along queues are versioned using [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/).
They should always be backwards and forwards compatible, but we still recommend
keeping an eye on the [changelog](/changelog) for any breaking changes and keeping
your SDKs and the Relay image on the latest version.

# Documentation

Documentation remains up to date and will not include versioning until 1.0. You
can always check the [changelog](/changelog) for information on breaking changes.
