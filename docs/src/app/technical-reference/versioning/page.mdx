## Semantic Versioning

Until TacoQ reaches 1.0, it will adhere to the following versioning scheme:

- The major version will be 0 until 1.0.
- The minor version increases for breaking changes or major features.
- The patch version increases for non-breaking changes.

After 1.0, TacoQ will follow [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## SDK and Image Lockstep Releases

Until TacoQ stabelizes at 1.0, SDKs and images always share the same minor 
version number. For example:

- If a breaking change happens in the Relay, both the Relay and SDKs are bumped
  to a new minor version.
- If a breaking change happens in the SDK, both the SDK and the Relay image are
  bumped to a new minor version.

Patch versions are not locked, but always reset to 0 when a minor version is
bumped.

## Message Versioning

Currently, changes to the task object can cause compatibility issues, preventing 
your workers and relays from processing messages and NACK'ing them. To upgrade
without compatibility issues, follow these steps:

1. Shut down your publisher.
2. Work through all the messages in your queue until they are all processed.
3. Handle any necessary operations on your task objects. They will be deleted
from the database.
4. Purge your database.
5. Upgrade your worker, relay, and publisher to the new version.
6. You can now begin publishing tasks again!

Future releases will introduce Task object versioning using an Avro-like setup
to improve compatibility and make upgrades more robust. For now, prioritizing
fast iteration outweighs the benefits of versioned Task objects.

## Documentation

Documentation remains up to date and will not include versioning until 1.0.
