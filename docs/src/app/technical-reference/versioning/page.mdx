# Semantic Versioning

Until TacoQ reaches 1.0, it will adhere to the following versioning scheme:

- The **major** version will stay at 0.
- The **minor** version increases for breaking changes or major features.
- The **patch** version increases for non-breaking changes.

Once we reach a stable 1.0, TacoQ will follow [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

# SDK and Image Lockstep Releases

For the time being, SDKs and images always share the same minor version number.
For example:

- If a breaking change happens in the Relay, both the Relay and SDKs are bumped
  to a new minor version, even if nothing changed for the SDKs.
- If a breaking change happens in the SDK, both the SDK and the Relay image are
  bumped to a new minor version, even if nothing changed for the Relay.

Patch versions are not locked, but always reset to 0 when a minor version is
bumped.

# Task Object

Currently, changes to the task object can cause compatibility issues, preventing
your workers and relays from processing messages and NACK'ing them. To upgrade
without compatibility issues, follow the [version upgrading guide](/guides/upgrading).

Future releases will introduce Task object versioning using an Avro-like setup
to improve compatibility and make upgrades more robust.

# Documentation

Documentation remains up to date and will not include versioning until 1.0. You
can always check the [changelog](/changelog) for information on breaking changes.
