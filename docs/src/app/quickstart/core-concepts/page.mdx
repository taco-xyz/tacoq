# What is TacoQ?

TacoQ is a task queue system that allows you to schedule tasks to be executed
asynchronously in workers outside your application. (e.g. in a different container).

# Core Concepts: Rapid-fire Overview

To properly use TacoQ, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding
of the core concepts of task queues. This section will provide a rapid-fire
overview of the most important topics so you can hit the ground running.

## Tasks

**Tasks are a unit of work that can be scheduled to be executed asynchronously**.
Here are some core properties of tasks that you should know about:

- Tasks have a `worker_kind` and a `task_kind`, which are used to identify
  which set of workers should execute each task (respectively). If you are
  familiar with message brokers, you can think of them as routing keys.
- Tasks have a `priority` value, which is used to sort tasks and determine which
  ones to assign to workers first. Once a task reaches a worker, its priority
  will no longer matter and it will be executed no matter what its priority is.
- When generated, tasks get an `id`, which is a unique identifier for the task
  that can be later used to retrieve the task's status and results.
  
## Message Broker

**The message broker carries task assignments, status updates, and results across the
entire TacoQ system**. The broker is also responsible for routing the tasks to the
correct set of workers based on its properties.

<Note>
  TacoQ uses [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) as its message broker.
</Note>

## Workers

Workers receive task assignments from the message broker, **execute them**, and then
send the result back through the message broker so they can be stored in the database.

<Note>

TacoQ uses [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as its database.

</Note>

## Publisher Client

To publish a task, you can use a publisher client that abstracts away the 
message broker and **allows you to send a task to the workers and database.**

<Tip>
  The publisher does not need to be a dedicated application. Instead, any
  service can embed the publisher in its code to publish tasks, **even workers**.
</Tip>

## Relay

The relay is a unique concept to TacoQ. It is a service that **acts as TacoQ's
core engine**, and has the following characteristics:

- It **abstracts away the data store** where tasks are registered **behind a REST API**.
- It consumes messages from the broker to **continiously update the data store**.

<Note>
  The relay is horizontally scalable and can be easily replicated.
</Note>

# What makes TacoQ different?

TacoQ aims to differentiate itself from other task queues by providing the
following features:

- **Multi-language interoperability** (e.g. schedule a CPU-intensive task to be
  executed by a Rust worker from a Python application, generate a cute PDF
  in a Javascript worker from a Rust API).
- **Modern SDKs** for popular languages like Python, supporting async functions,
  `pydantic`, having a type safe API, built-in hot reloading, and more.
- **Integration via REST API**, allowing languages without a dedicated SDK to
  easily schedule and retrieve task results.
- Great developer experience with a focus on **programmer ergonomics, good
  documentation, and explainability** (for example, with built-in observability).

<Tip>
  You can learn more about TacoQ's architecture and design in the [System
  Architecture](/technical-reference/system-architecture) section.
