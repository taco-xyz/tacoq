# What is TacoQ?

TacoQ is a task queue system that allows you to schedule tasks to be executed
asynchronously in workers outside your application. (e.g. in a different container).

# Core Concepts: Rapid-fire Overview

## Tasks

Tasks are a unit of work that can be scheduled to be executed asynchronously.
They have the following properties:

- Tasks are uniquely represented by a string identifier `kind`. (e.g.
  `"my_custom_task"`), which is used by workers to identify which task to run.
- Tasks have a `priority` value, which is used to sort tasks and determine which
  ones to assign to workers first.

## Message Broker

The message broker carries task assignments, updates, and results across the 
entire TacoQ system. The broker is also responsible for routing the tasks to the
correct set of workers based on its properties. 

> [!NOTE]
> TacoQ uses RabbitMQ as its message broker.

## Workers

Workers receive task assignments from the message broker, execute them, and then
send the result back through the message broker so they can be stored in the database.

> [!NOTE]
> TacoQ uses Postgres as its database.

## Publishers

Publishers are services that publish tasks to the message broker. They can then
query the TacoQ's REST API to retrieve the results and current status of the task.

## Relay

The relay is a unique concept to TacoQ. It is essentially TacoQ's engine, and has
the following properties:

- Hosts a REST API that enables any SDK or even non-supported languages to retrieve
  task results and status. Task publishing is traditionally done through the broker,
  but the relay also allows for task publishing for non-supported languages.
- Is a permanent consumer of messages from the broker to update the database with
  the latest task statuses and results.
- Is horizontally scalable and can be scaled to run thousands of instances.

# What makes TacoQ different?

From a high level perspective, TacoQ aims to differentiate itself from other task
queues by providing the following features:

- Multi-language interoperability (e.g. schedule a CPU-intensive task to be 
  executed by a Rust worker from a Python application).
- Modern SDKs for popular languages like Python, supporting async functions,
  `pydantic`, having a type safe API, built-in hot reloading, and more.
- A REST API, allowing languages without an SDK to schedule and retrieve task
  results.
- Is horizontally scalable and can be scaled to run thousands of workers.
