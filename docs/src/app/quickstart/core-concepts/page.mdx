# What is TacoQ?

TacoQ is a task queue system that allows you to schedule tasks to be executed
asynchronously in workers outside your application. (e.g. in a different container).

# Core Concepts: Rapid-fire Overview

To properly use TacoQ, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding
of the core concepts of task queues. This section will provide a rapid-fire
overview of the most important topics so you can hit the ground running.

## Tasks

Tasks are a unit of work that can be scheduled to be executed asynchronously.
Here are some core properties of tasks that you should know about:

- Tasks have a `worker_kind` and a `task_kind`, which are used to identify
  which set of workers should execute each task (respectively). If you are
  familiar with message queues, you can think of them as routing keys.
- Tasks have a `priority` value, which is used to sort tasks and determine which
  ones to assign to workers first. Once a task reaches a worker, its priority
  will no longer matter and it will be executed no matter what its priority is.
- When generated, tasks get an `id`, which is a unique identifier for the task
  that can be later used to retrieve the task's status and results.
- Tasks have a `status` that can be `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, or `COMPLETED`. If
  the task has been completed, the `is_error` field will be set to either `true`
  or `false` depending on the success of the task.

## Message Broker

The message broker carries task assignments, updates, and results across the
entire TacoQ system. The broker is also responsible for routing the tasks to the
correct set of workers based on its properties.

<Note>
  TacoQ uses [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) as its message broker.
</Note>

## Workers

Workers receive task assignments from the message broker, execute them, and then
send the result back through the message broker so they can be stored in the database.

<Note>

TacoQ uses [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as its database.

</Note>

## Publishers

Publishers are services that publish tasks to the message broker.

<Tip>
  The publisher does not need to be a dedicated application. Instead, any
  service can embed the publisher in its code to publish tasks. (even workers!).
</Tip>

## Relay

The relay is a unique concept to TacoQ. It is a service that acts as TacoQ's
engine, and has the following characteristics:

- Hosts a REST API that enables any SDK or even non-supported languages to
  retrieve a task's result and status. Task publishing is done through the
  message broker when possible, but the relay also allows for task publishing
  for languages without an SDK.
- Acts as a permanent consumer of messages from the broker to update the
  database with the latest task statuses and results.
- Is horizontally scalable and can be replicated to run thousands of instances.

# What makes TacoQ different?

TacoQ aims to differentiate itself from other task queues by providing the
following features:

- Multi-language interoperability (e.g. schedule a CPU-intensive task to be
  executed by a Rust worker from a Python application, generate a cute PDF
  in a Javascript worker from a Rust API).
- Modern SDKs for popular languages like Python, supporting async functions,
  `pydantic`, having a type safe API, built-in hot reloading, and more.
- Integration via REST API, allowing languages without a dedicated SDK to
  easily schedule and retrieve task results.
- Great developer experience with a focus on programmer ergonomics, good
  documentation, and explainability (for example, with built-in observability).

<Tip>
  You can learn more about TacoQ's architecture and design in the [System
  Architecture](/technical-reference/system-architecture) section.
