# Hot Reloading

You can develop your worker with hot reloading by running it in the same

# Implementation

You can set up the worker to run along with the rest of your application
by running it in the background in an idiomatic way:

```python
# Set up your application as normal
worker_app = WorkerApplication(...)

# Instead of running the worker app via the CLI or a dedicated
# entrypoint, run it the background as a co-routine.
asyncio.create_task(worker_app.entrypoint())

# When you are done using your worker, you can stop it
# by calling the shutdown method.
worker_app.shutdown()

# If you want to wait for the worker to finish cleaning up the remaining
# tasks, you can await the `wait_for_shutdown` method.
await worker_app.wait_for_shutdown()
```

<Warning>
  This pattern is **not recommended for production use** because: - It is
  important to separate the resources used by your worker and your application.
  - You cannot horizontally scale your worker by running multiple instances. -
  Your worker may have blocking tasks that will interfere with your
  application's performance. If you are using an asynchronous runtime like
  `tokio`, the impact of blocking tasks may not be as pronounced due to the
  multiple threads available. In `asyncio`, however, a blocking task in your
  worker will block the entire process.
